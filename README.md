## EG-WALKER (GO)
This repository intends to be an implementation of the eg-walker algorithm for collaborative text editing (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14252)) heavily inspired by the reference implementation by Joseph Gentle

### Milestones
1. Definition

This milestone involves the definition of intended behaviours and an understanding of the eg-walker algorithm. It will involve the creation of a test suite and some documents underlying the implementation used in this repository

2. Implementation

This milestone involves the actual implementation of the eg-walker library in go by passing the test suite. It will also mean a reference implementation of a server/client (or mocking a server/client) using the algorithm to synchronize states

3. Verification

This milestone will mean a formal verification of the correctness of the implementation (whatever that means...)
